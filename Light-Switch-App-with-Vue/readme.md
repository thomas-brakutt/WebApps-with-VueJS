# Task: Light Switch App with Vue

In this task we use the `v-on` directive to create a vue version of our [light switch app](https://github.com/coding-bootcamps-eu/web-apps-foundation/blob/main/web-app-basics/01-light-switch.md) from the `web apps foundation` module.

## Fulfill the following tasks:

- [ ] Try to refactor your existing (plain js and html) light switch with VueJS.
  - [ ] If you didn't solve that issue before start from scratch!

## Hint

You can access elements, that are outsite of the VueJS mounted container (like the document title or body) with regular JS.

```js
Vue.createApp({
  data() {
    return {
      text: "Hello Title",
      onClassName: "is-active",
    };
  },
  methods: {
    active() {
      document.title = this.text;
      document.body.classList.add(this.onClassName);
    },
  },
}).mount("#app");
```
