Fulfill the following tasks:

- [ ] Don't start from scratch! Use the provided resources in the `src` folder of this coding task.
- [ ] Convert the headline data property into a valid id and set the ID to the `h1` element.
  - Tipp: Id's are always lowercase and only contain letters, number, dashes and underscores. Spaces are not allowed. The replace method will help you.
