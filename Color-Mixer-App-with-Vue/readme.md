# Task: color-mixer App with Vue

In this task we use the `v-on` directive to create a vue version of our [color-mixer app](https://github.com/coding-bootcamps-eu/web-apps-foundation/blob/main/web-app-basics/05-color-mixer.md) from the `web apps foundation` module.

## Fulfill the following tasks:

- [ ] Try to refactor your existing (plain js and html) color mixer with VueJS.
  - [ ] If you didn't solve that issue before start from scratch!
