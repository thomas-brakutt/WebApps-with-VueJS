# Kata: Todo App with VueJS

Please refactor the Todo app to a VueJS App.
Feel free to use your old pure javascript version as base for this one.

## Features üç°

The list of features is ordered by descending priority.

**Must Have Features üòä**

- [ ] Todos can be added using the add button
- [ ] List all added todos
- [ ] Added todos can be marked as done

**Nice To Have Features üòè**

- [ ] Add styling according to design requirements
- [ ] Add a filter which allows to display either "all todos", "open todos" or "done todos"
- [ ] Add a button which will delete all done todos

**If You Really Have Time Features ü•≥**

- [ ] Add a check that allows only todos with 5 or more characters
- [ ] Add a feature that allows to add todos when pressing enter in the textbox
- [ ] Display the text of done todos different than the text of open todos
