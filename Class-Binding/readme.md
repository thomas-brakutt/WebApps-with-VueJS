## Fulfill the following tasks:

- [ ] Don't start from scratch! Sources are provided in the `src` folder of this directory.
- [ ] Implement the following logic with the use of `class binding` and the `v-on directive`.
  - [ ] When any button was clicked, add css classes to the button and the associated letter block below to set them as active.
  - Example: Click on button B
    - button B add css class `btn-active`
    - block B add css class `letter-active`
  - [ ] Use the data property `activeLetter` to store the current letter
    - A was clicked -> activeLetter: "A"
    - C was clicked -> activeLetter: "C"
